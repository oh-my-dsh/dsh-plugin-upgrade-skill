## Version corridor index

Build corridors along the `from → to` directed edges in the table, never by filename
order — lexicographically, `alpha.10` sorts before `alpha.2`. When the target spans
multiple versions, read the full corridor and compute the final net state before touching
source: if a field is removed in alpha.1 and restored in alpha.2, do not delete and re-add it.

| Order | Card file | from | to | Cards | Status / coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| 0 | [v0.1.1-rc.1.md](v0.1.1-rc.1.md) | `dsh-v0.1.0-rc.8` | `dsh-v0.1.1-rc.1` | 9 | draft / curated (vlln plugin migrations: repository-plugins mechanism removal, `dshClient`→`dsh.client` manifest merge, client-modules scan → bundle `dsh.client`, strict inject + weak `ctx.get`, session event contract (`type` not `kind`), self-rendering client session aggregation, `tasks.peek` removal, 0812 service renames — `httpServer`→`webServer`, `tasks`→`jobs`; corridor is the closest published-tag alignment for the internal 0810–0812 snapshot window, upstream review may reassign) |
| 1 | [v0.1.1-rc.2.md](v0.1.1-rc.2.md) | `dsh-v0.1.1-rc.1` | `dsh-v0.1.1-rc.2` | 3 | reviewed / curated |

| 9 | [v0.1.3-alpha.2.md](v0.1.3-alpha.2.md) | `dsh-v0.1.3-alpha.1` | `dsh-v0.1.3-alpha.2` | 5 | draft / curated (persona `text`/`persona` config splits into prefix + suffix with `PERSONA_SECTION` removed, `SubprocessHandle.pid` removal, base bundle drops the `tool-str-replace-editor` default row, launcher `runCli()`/`import.meta.main`, pi-ai `^0.84.2`→`^0.85.1`; first 0.1.3 build on npm — alpha.1 items debut for npm upgrades, read the [alpha.1 corridor](v0.1.3-alpha.1.md) first) |
| 10 | [v0.1.5-alpha.1.md](v0.1.5-alpha.1.md) | `dsh-v0.1.3-alpha.2` | `dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1` | 20 | draft / curated (version-jump edge: the tag/npm corridor goes straight from 0.1.3-alpha.2 to 0.1.5-alpha.1; Session log format V3 via the new `session-format-v2-to-v3` with `EpochHeader.system` removed and no downgrade read, `ctx.agent` removed with explicit `AgentSetup(agentCtx, agent)`/`parentAgent`, `Inbox` becomes a type interface at `agent.inbox`, tighter session-event payload validation, PTC vocabulary rename, `token-meter` export removal + `contextBreakdown` stateVersion 4, system prompts move into message history, forwarded scoped Remote events must carry the Agent, CLI rejects the `desktop` profile, `--from-default-profile`/`loadProfileDirectory()`, the `workspaceFiles`/`readByteRange`/`/api/file` file surface, `goal/activation-changed`, the `fs-ext`→`node-addon-system` packaging change, the Web Client `details`→`rightbar` rework and injection-surface signature changes, new right-sidebar/resource extension points, file links opening in the sidebar, the `tool-subagent` scoped-preset requirement, and the host SSH/directory-picker/instruction-discovery seam changes) |
| 11 | [v0.1.5-alpha.2.md](v0.1.5-alpha.2.md) | `dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1` | `dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.2` | 24 | draft / curated (`workspaceFiles` drops the `Agent` parameter for a Typert `workspaceFileScope`, unconfined file reads with `maxFileBytes` + `readAll`/`readRelated`, `conversation` moves under root-scoped `main` with `sidebar.panellist`, shell-only minimal profiles, two non-ignorable session events (`deliverables/presented`, `subagent/catalog`), `dsh-llm-pi-ai` config/type changes, scope-aware tool guidance, `present`/reveal delivery surface, document previews + `ui-sidebar-textpreview`→`ui-sidebar-documentpreview`, new `chunked-list`/`tool-present` packages, MCP pagination-cursor rejection, session-format-status doc; plus 12 client/packaging cards: `rightbar` becomes root-scoped with `rightbar.session` and the layout service/store is rewritten, `client-resources` drops `reload`, `ui-primitives` file-type icons replace `DocumentFileIcon`, `ui-dockkit` contract drift, `ui-message-feedback` injected surface rewrite, `ui-workspace` navigation service, `ChatFileMentions.forClosing` + deliverables turn tail, browser-only deps move to `devDependencies`, `ctx.documentPreviews` registry, `ActionSpec` commands, `command-feedback` subpaths + Host Remote, sidebar-right lazy default pages/close rules; on npm since 2026-09-09) |

This edge is 17 commits) |
| 13 | [v0.1.5-rc.2.md](v0.1.5-rc.2.md) | `dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1` | `dsh-v0.1.5-rc.2` | 6 | draft / curated (Web Client face only: the feedback surface's injected contract loses `toggle`/`acknowledge` and `openDialog` gains a required `rating`, both ratings now confirm in the dialog and a failed submission becomes a 6s warning toast, `FileTypeIcon`'s 48 code-category icons move to the design-export artwork injected as markup with per-instance `dsh-code-icon-*` ids, the completed-turn footer and file-section spacing become a documented 20/16/20px contract, and `service-stability` is re-labelled `Stability and speed` / `稳定性和速度`; no Host-plane package carries a behavior change — 272 of the 334 changed files are version strings; corridor order 13 because rows 10–12 for `0.1.3-alpha.2→0.1.5-alpha.1`, `0.1.5-alpha.1→0.1.5-alpha.2` and `0.1.5-alpha.2→0.1.5-rc.1` land with #197/#199/#204) |

| — | [rollup-0.1.2.md](rollup-0.1.2.md) | `dsh-v0.1.1-rc.2` → `dsh-v0.1.2-rc.1` full corridor | rollup | non-card file: corridor-level increment (cross-cohort coexistence, unpublished-cohort installation, `RemoteResult` error flow, pre-migration baseline attribution, bounded retry for boot race, base-only preset precondition, type-surface export drift, host-self safety boundary, three install-channel pitfalls, layered validation checklist); based on rc.1, subject to final-release review |

`curated` means only the identified plugin-relevant changes are included, not a complete
API diff. When a corridor edge is missing, stop the automatic migration and report the gap
to the user; one-off upstream research for the current task and adding cards to this
repository are two different activities — the latter must not become an implicit side
effect of modifying the user's plugin.

## Card file metadata

Each `vX.Y.Z-<suffix>.md` declares, in its frontmatter:

```yaml
---
kind: dsh-version-card-set
schema: 1
from: dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1
to: dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.2
status: reviewed
coverage: curated
cardCount: 4
idPrefix: DSH-0.1.2-A2
verifiedAt: 2026-08-30
---
```

Version order is determined by `from`/`to`; `cardCount`, the ID prefix, and the required
fields are checked by the repository's validation scripts.

## Single-card format

```markdown
### DSH-0.1.2-A2-01 · Title

- **Type**: breaking | behavior | capability | fix | security | privacy
- **Applies to**: client / server plugin / profile wrapper / packaging, etc.
- **Touchpoints**: #1…#7, or "none (packaging/privacy surface)"
- **Action level**: required | required-if-hit | required-if-target-is-… | conditional | optional | informational
- **Symptoms**: what breaks or changes after the upgrade
- **Migration recipe**: checkable steps; old→new ledger (where applicable)
- **Verification**: how to prove the final behavior, not just that installation succeeded
- **Source**: primary source pinned to a fixed release tag / commit
- **Field note** (optional): reproducible real-world migration differences, noting date, plugin, platform, and version
```

Rules:

1. The ID must include the full host version and be unique within the repository;
2. every card cites at least one primary source; when same-version material exists, prefer pinning to the same tag;
3. when release notes give direction only, without API coordinates, the recipe must require re-checking the target tag's types — do not invent interfaces;
4. cross-version rollbacks/restores are cross-referenced by full ID;
5. when local observation conflicts with a primary source, reproduce first and record the difference side by side; never silently overwrite either side.
