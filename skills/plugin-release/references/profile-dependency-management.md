# Profile dependency management recipes

> Carries on the release-track choice of [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). This document covers the dependency-resolution facts and operational recipes for installing/updating plugins into `$DSH_HOME/profiles/*`, drawn from the continuous migration of the 17 plugin repositories across four version steps (0.1.0-rc.8 → 0.1.1-rc.2 → 0.1.2-alpha.1 → 0.1.2-alpha.2 → 0.1.2-alpha.3). Technical migration pitfalls
> (tsbuildinfo, oxc parsing, etc.) are covered in [migration-hygiene](https://github.com/oh-my-dsh/dsh-plugin-upgrade-skill/blob/main/skills/plugin-upgrade/references/migration-hygiene.md);
> this document does not repeat them.

## 1. Resolution facts for the two install tracks

| Declaration | Resolution behavior | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| `link:<absolute path>` | Directory junction/symlink straight to the local directory; no version resolution | Local development, during batch migration |
| `github:owner/repo` | Resolves the default-branch HEAD; the lockfile records the exact commit of the source archive URL (codeload) | Release installs, consumer side |

The two tracks can be mixed within one profile; handle renames, migration, and wrap-up per the items below.

## 2. The github dependency lock-cache pitfall: `Already up to date` does not mean you got the new commit

**Symptom**: a new commit was pushed upstream, `pnpm install` prints `Already up to date`, and the codeload URL in the lockfile is still the old commit; the code loaded at startup is still the old code.

**Cause**: pnpm caches HEAD resolution for github dependencies; a regular `install` does not re-resolve.

**Fix**:

```sh
# Force re-resolution of the github dependency (run for the web and headless profiles separately)
cd "$DSH_HOME/profiles/web" && pnpm update <pkg>
# Verify that the commit in the lockfile equals the expected HEAD
grep 'codeload.*<pkg>' pnpm-lock.yaml   # should be tar.gz/<40-char commit>
```

During batch-migration wrap-up, run `pnpm update` once for every github-track dependency, then verify the commit.

## 3. Three-place sync when a plugin's npm package is renamed (package name prefix change)

When the package name changes from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-x` to `@org/dsh-x`, the following three places must agree, or the Loader fails to resolve:

1. the dependencies key in the profile `package.json` (install name);
2. the profile `dsh.profile.bundles` entry (bundle name);
3. the `name` line in the plugin's own `cordis.patch.yml`.

**Residue cleanup**: after a rename, `pnpm install` may keep the old-name directory junction (old and new directories coexist). After confirming that the lockfile contains only the new name, manually delete the leftover `node_modules/@old-prefix/old-package` directory.

## 4. Update semantics of the shared fallback node_modules and directory junctions

- The profile's own `node_modules` contains only the profile's declared dependencies; when a bare row name fails to resolve, resolution falls back to the shared `$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules` (which holds copies of the app's and each bundle's declared dependencies).
- When a directory junction points at a local workspace package, **a workspace source update takes effect once dsh is restarted**; host-half changes require a restart, and only then can the client half hard-refresh (see item 3 of [migration-hygiene](https://github.com/oh-my-dsh/dsh-plugin-upgrade-skill/blob/main/skills/plugin-upgrade/references/migration-hygiene.md)).
- The profile root `cordis.yml` is rewritten to `[]` at boot (composition facts live in the patch layer) — **do not edit it by hand**; edit `cordis.patch.yml` instead.

## 5. Profile linkage order after a host tag upgrade

1. Check out the exact tag → `pnpm install` → `pnpm run clean` → `pnpm run build` (clean rules out tsbuildinfo false positives);
2. After the batch plugin migration is done and pushed to each repository, return to the profile: `pnpm update` re-resolves the github-track dependencies;
3. Verify the row set with `dsh --profile <p> --dump-config`;
4. Real cold boot: once dsh at the target tag is up, the plugin's entry in the plugin inventory (pluginInventory) is `active`, with no `pending`.

## 6. Browser-free authentication smoke for custom channels

Since 0.1.2-alpha.1, dsh web uses bootstrap-token + signed-Cookie authentication (see
[DSH-0.1.2-A1-08 · Web/API channel authentication](https://github.com/oh-my-dsh/dsh-plugin-upgrade-skill/blob/main/skills/plugin-upgrade/references/v0.1.2-alpha.1.md)).
When a plugin has its own HTTP/RPC channel (such as `/tariff/status`), use the flow below before publishing to prove that "the channel really sits behind the unified authentication", without relying on a browser/Playwright. Known behavior: the token can be exchanged repeatedly within the same process and only rotates on restart; a custom route inherits authentication only when registered through `connection` — a bare `ctx.webServer.register()` does not inherit.

PowerShell (with its own Cookie container):

```powershell
# 1. Grab the auth URL from the startup output: dsh web: http://127.0.0.1:3190/?token=<T>
# 2. Exchange the Cookie
$sess = New-Object Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebRequestSession
Invoke-WebRequest "http://127.0.0.1:3190/?token=$token" -WebSession $sess -UseBasicParsing
# 3. Call the custom channel with the session → assert 200
$body = @{ type = 'client-request'; rpcId = 'smoke'; method = 'status'; payload = $null } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-WebRequest 'http://127.0.0.1:3190/tariff/status' -Method POST -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body -WebSession $sess
# 4. Resend without authentication → assert 401 (proves the channel is protected)
Invoke-WebRequest 'http://127.0.0.1:3190/tariff/status' -Method POST -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body
```

curl equivalent (`-c/-b` cookie jar):

```sh
curl -s -c jar.txt "http://127.0.0.1:3190/?token=$TOKEN" >/dev/null      # exchange the Cookie (303→/)
curl -s -b jar.txt -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"client-request","rpcId":"smoke","method":"status","payload":null}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:3190/tariff/status        # expect 200
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:3190/tariff/status        # expect 401
```

## 7. Validation checklist

- [ ] Every github dependency's commit in the lockfile equals the expected HEAD;
- [ ] A renamed plugin uses the same name in the lockfile, the bundles list, and `cordis.patch.yml`, and the old directory junction has been cleaned up;
- [ ] The `--dump-config` row set matches expectations;
- [ ] Real cold boot leaves the entry active;
- [ ] After a host upgrade, check the affected profile's resolved package paths and versions against the intended target cohort, including profile-local overrides; reload the host after replacing a loaded package and read back the affected flow (Section 12).
- [ ] Custom-channel authentication smoke: 401 without authentication, 200 after exchanging the Cookie (Section 6 flow).

## 8. Plugin version must be routed by DSH version (a wrong pick crashes)

Different versions of the same plugin target different DSH versions. The DSH client API is
**forward-incompatible across rc.x → alpha.x**: a plugin built for the wrong DSH version does not
degrade gracefully — it crashes at runtime with a symptom that looks unrelated to the plugin.

**Symptom**: console `TypeError: useConversation is not a function` (or another missing slot seat);
"restart, hot-reload, edit cordis.patch.yml" all fail to fix it.

**Root cause**: a plugin built against the `0.1.2-alpha.1` client API was installed into
`0.1.1-rc.2` (npm latest). The two client contracts differ, so the plugin reads a seat the host
never provided.

**Fix**: pick the plugin version matching the DSH version. Put a one-glance version matrix at the top
of the plugin README:

| Your DSH | Plugin version to install |
|---|---|
| `0.1.1-rc.2` (npm latest) | the old (rc.1/rc.2-compatible) version, using its pinned tag |
| `0.1.2-alpha.1 / alpha.2` | the new version (the default command) |

Give consumers a self-check clue in a README callout: *a wrong pick crashes; common symptom
`useConversation is not a function`*. Do not expose only a "latest version" default command — that
sends rc.x users to a forward-incompatible build.

## 9. Every tag referenced by the docs must exist on every mirror

**Symptom**: installing by the README's pinned tag fails with
`Could not resolve vN.N.N to a commit of https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git`.

**Root cause**: the repo is distributed across mirrors (private primary + public mirrors), but the
publish/sync script pushes branches only, never tags — historical tags never reached the public
mirrors, so the version pinned in the docs cannot be resolved.

**Fix** (both parts):

1. The publish/sync script must append `git push <remote> --tags` (non-forced) after each branch
   push, so every release tag is synced to all mirrors;
2. Consumers can confirm a tag exists first with
   `git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/<org>/<repo>`.

**Maintainer self-check after a release**: verify across mirrors with the API — query
`repos/<org>/<repo>/git/refs/tags/<tag>` per tag and re-push any that are missing. This is the same
class of check as "lockfile commit equals expected HEAD" (Section 2): if the docs say it installs,
it must actually install.

## 10. The in-plugin update prompt must carry its own routing and rescue notes

**Symptom**: a consumer clicks the plugin's "new version available" chip, pastes the copied update
prompt, and the agent runs it verbatim — against a DSH version the tag was never built for, or with
no idea where to look when the install fails. The README's version matrix (Section 8) never enters
the picture: **the prompt is the only guidance the user sees at that moment.**

**Root cause**: the update prompt is generated inside the plugin with a single pinned tag and only
the mechanical install steps. Version routing lived one browser tab away, and troubleshooting
pointers lived only in the README — so the most common failure paths (wrong DSH version, pnpm 11
build-script block, install errors) hit the user with zero context.

**Fix** — the prompt a chip copies must be self-sufficient:

1. **Step 0, before any command**: run `dsh --version` and check it against the README
   compatibility table; if the prompt's tag does not match the consumer's DSH version, install the
   table's matching tag instead (a wrong pick crashes — Section 8's symptom applies unchanged).
2. **The install command** with the pinned tag, plus the pnpm 11 `approve-builds` escape hatch.
3. **The hard-refresh reminder** after the install.
4. **A final troubleshooting step**: on install failure / version mismatch / startup errors, consult
   the README's compatibility and known-limitations sections first.

Keep one prompt template across a plugin family (only the package spec and repo URL differ), so a
fix to the routing wording ships once and every plugin's next release carries it. This is a
documentation-in-code contract: treat prompt wording changes like behavior changes — bump, release,
and let the chip distribute them.

## 11. Version constants baked at build time: rebuild before tagging, or the tag lies about itself

**Symptom**: right after publishing `vX.Y.Z+1`, a consumer on the *latest* install clicks the
plugin's update chip, installs the new tag, and the chip **still** offers an update to
`vX.Y.Z+1`. The README matrix, the git tag, and `package.json` all say the new version; only the
running plugin disagrees. (Real case: dsh-file-trace v0.3.1, 2026-09-04 — the update chip kept
prompting immediately after the release was pushed.)

**Root cause**: the plugin reads its version via `import pkg from '../../package.json'` in
**source**, but what ships is the **built bundle** (`lib/client.js`): the bundler replaces the
import at build time and bakes the then-current version string into the artifact. Bumping
`package.json` and tagging **without rebuilding** publishes a tag whose manifest says
`X.Y.Z+1` while its artifact still carries `X.Y.Z` — a self-inconsistent tag. Every
version-comparison surface that reads the artifact (update chip, about panel, diagnostics) now
compares old-against-new and reports an update forever. This bites hardest for repos that commit
build outputs (`lib/` tracked in git) precisely because "just bump the manifest" *looks* like a
complete doc-only release.

**Fix** — make the artifact part of the release, not an afterthought:

1. **Bump → rebuild → commit together**: change `package.json`, run the full build, and commit
   manifest + rebuilt artifacts in the same commit before tagging. For a doc-only release the
   rebuilt bundle is the *only* functional change — it is the release.
2. **Gate**: extract the version constant actually consumed by the update check from the built
   artifact (or read it by executing the bundle in an isolated test harness), and require exact
   string equality with `package.json.version`, including prerelease and build metadata. A missing,
   ambiguous, or mismatched value blocks tagging. A whole-bundle grep is insufficient: `0.3.1`
   also matches `0.3.1-rc.1`, and a dependency's version does not identify the plugin's version.
3. **Recovery for an already-pushed inconsistent tag**: record each mirror's current branch and
   tag ref OIDs before the repair. Rebuild, amend the release commit (or add a fix commit), and
   re-point the tag. Push the intended branch and tag together with **separate explicit leases**:

   ```sh
   git push --atomic \
     --force-with-lease=refs/heads/<branch>:<old-branch-oid> \
     --force-with-lease=refs/tags/<tag>:<old-tag-oid> \
     <remote> refs/heads/<branch>:refs/heads/<branch> refs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>
   ```

   Use the OIDs recorded for that mirror; for an annotated tag, the lease needs the tag object's
   OID, not its peeled commit SHA. If a lease fails, stop and inspect the concurrent change; do
   not retry with `-f`. Repeat for every mirror, then verify each mirror's branch and tag target
   SHAs. Acceptable only while the tag is fresh enough that consumers pinning it are known;
   otherwise cut `X.Y.Z+2`.

Related: Section 9 (the re-pointed tag must land on **every** mirror) and Section 10 (the update
chip is the surface where this bug becomes user-visible — a chip that never clears is this section's
signature symptom, not a prompt-wording problem).

## 12. Profile-local packages can survive a host upgrade

Community report [#263](https://github.com/oh-my-dsh/dsh-plugin-upgrade-skill/issues/263)
describes an upgrade to `0.1.7-rc.2` where an older profile-local
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-schedule` remained under
`~/.dsh/profiles/<profile>/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/`. The affected scheduled
flow repeatedly failed with `format v4 message requires a producer-owned source kind`.
The reporter attributed the failure to the host resolving the old package and reported
recovery only after refreshing the package **and restarting the host**. This is a
community diagnosis, not a universal explanation of that error or a reproduction by
this guide's authors.

For this symptom after a host upgrade:

1. Inspect the affected profile's declared dependencies and lockfile, plus the package
   path actually resolved by that host/profile. Record the real path, package version,
   and expected target-cohort source. Compare profile-local copies, linked workspaces,
   and the shared/main installation separately. Modification times can help locate a
   stale candidate, but do not establish compatibility; equal versions can also hide
   different copied or built content.
2. If the resolved package is stale, plan a targeted refresh using that profile's
   existing installation track and package manager. Preserve the manifest, lockfile,
   and resolved source identity needed for rollback. Do not delete every profile's
   `node_modules` or assume that removing a local directory will produce a compatible
   fallback; confirm the resulting resolution and cohort first. Obtain authorization
   for the affected profile changes under the owning upgrade workflow.
3. Restart the affected host through its normal lifecycle after the package refresh.
   Replacing files does not prove that the running process stopped using the old
   loaded package; a browser refresh alone is not a host restart.
4. Verify the newly resolved path/version and cold-boot activation. Then exercise the
   affected scheduled flow and read back its persisted result. An `accepted` response
   alone does not prove that the session write succeeded. Record what was actually
   observed, and investigate other causes if the error remains.

Keep the source report, target host version, profile identity, package identities,
restart evidence, and behavior readback with the upgrade record. The report's recovery
is evidence for this checklist; it does not replace validation of a consumer's profile.
