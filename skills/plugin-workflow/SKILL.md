name: plugin-workflow
description: Coordinate the complete DeepSeek Harness plugin lifecycle across inspection, host compatibility upgrades, tests, naming and central registry checks, packaging, release, and rollback. Use when a user wants one guided workflow, asks which plugin capabilities to run, requests a pre-run feature menu, or needs several DSH plugin Skills chained with a unified status report. Default to read-only discovery and require separate confirmation before repository writes, dependency or runtime execution, and external publication.

# Coordinate the DSH Plugin Lifecycle

Act as the workflow controller. Let the user choose outcomes and optional proof before execution, route each selected stage to its owning Skill, preserve one phase ledger, and return one evidence-backed report. Do not copy the detailed rules of an owning Skill into this Skill.

## Start with read-only discovery

Inspect only enough context to make the choices concrete:

1. Read repository instructions and inspect Git status without changing it.
2. Identify whether the target is the DSH monorepo, an external plugin source repository, an installed plugin, or a packed artifact.
3. Record the plugin source identity, current DSH version, requested target version, package manager, available scripts, plugin surfaces, and existing naming declaration.
4. Mark missing inputs as `unknown`. Do not install dependencies, run package scripts, start containers, edit files, or query a remote registry during discovery.

If the user has already selected an outcome and supplied enough context, preserve that choice instead of asking again. Otherwise present the following compact menu and wait for selection. Default to `health-check` when the request is ambiguous.

## Choose one workflow

| Workflow | Outcome | Default stages |
|---|---|---|
| `health-check` | Read-only plugin and upgrade-risk report | discovery, optional DSH audit, seven-touchpoint scan |
| `upgrade-target` | Upgrade an installed plugin to an explicit version | discovery, upgrade, static checks, rollback record |
| `compatibility-migration` | Adapt plugin source to an exact DSH target | discovery, DSH audit, seven-touchpoint migration, static and runtime tests |
| `test-only` | Validate an existing source tree or artifact | discovery, selected test levels, report |
| `naming-registry` | Validate identifiers and optionally check or register a cloud ID | discovery, offline naming, registry query, optional registration |
| `package-release` | Prepare and optionally publish a release | discovery, required test gates, pack, consumer smoke, optional publication |
| `full-lifecycle` | Migrate, validate, name, package, and optionally publish | all applicable stages in dependency order |

Then let the user include or exclude these capabilities. Recommend the smallest set that proves their stated outcome and state which recommended items are still unselected.

| Capability | Choice | Default |
|---|---|---|
| DSH version compatibility audit | `dsh-audit` | On for compatibility migration; otherwise off |
| Seven-touchpoint plugin scan | `touchpoint-scan` | On for health checks and migrations |
| Typecheck, unit tests, and build | `static-tests` | On after source changes and before packaging |
| Exact-version Docker cold start | `docker-smoke` | On for migrations and release candidates when Docker is available |
| One real functional path | `functional-probe` | On for migrations and releases |
| Browser validation | `browser-check` | On only for Web Client or UI surfaces |
| Offline naming declaration validation | `naming-local` | On for new external plugins; otherwise opt-in |
| Central cloud registry lookup | `registry-query` | Off until selected; read-only |
| Central cloud ID registration | `registry-register` | Off; requires reviewed external publication |
| Rollback rehearsal or recipe | `rollback` | Recipe on for every write workflow; rehearsal is opt-in |
| Package and publish | `release` | Off unless release intent is explicit |

Do not treat `registry-query` as a reservation. Do not treat `registry-register` as required for local plugin use. A local plugin and the central registry may share a display name; only concrete identifiers on the same runtime surface can conflict, and the naming owner must report those exact matches.

## Build the phase ledger

Create one row per selected or dependency-required stage before execution:

| Phase | Capability | Owner | Status | Evidence or blocker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `P01` | discovery | `plugin-workflow` | `selected` | target and source identity |

Use only these status values:

- `selected`: chosen and not yet completed;
- `completed`: finished with evidence;
- `blocked`: attempted or required but unable to proceed;
- `skipped`: applicable but deliberately not run;
- `not_applicable`: irrelevant to the detected plugin surface or workflow.

Never turn an unavailable or unselected check into `completed`. When a phase is blocked, mark dependent phases `blocked` or `skipped` with the dependency reason and continue only with independent, authorized phases.

## Route each stage to its owner

Before executing a stage, load and follow its owning Skill. If the owner is unavailable, mark the phase `blocked`; do not recreate its implementation from memory.

| Stage | Owning Skill | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Installed update or source compatibility migration | `$plugin-upgrade` | Inspect first; confirm before config, dependency, or source changes |
| New plugin code or offline naming declaration | `$plugin-write` | Follow the exact target Harness contract |
| Static, runtime, Docker, functional, or browser validation | `$plugin-test` | Select the minimum sufficient levels and preserve evidence |
| Package, release gates, publication, and release rollback | `$plugin-release` | Confirm publication separately |
| DSH host version-to-version evidence | `$dsh-upgrade-audit` | Keep generated evidence separate from plugin source changes |

Run stages in dependency order:

1. discovery and source identity;
2. DSH audit when selected;
3. upgrade or implementation changes;
4. offline naming and optional registry query;
5. static tests;
6. Docker, functional, and browser proof;
7. release preparation and artifact inspection;
8. external registration or publication.

Skip stages that are not selected unless an owning Skill makes them a hard gate for a later selected stage. In that case, add the gate to the ledger, explain why it is required, and obtain any needed confirmation before running it.

## Enforce three confirmation boundaries

Group planned actions by boundary and never use approval for one boundary as approval for another:

1. **Repository writes**: show exact files, intended changes, and rollback scope before editing source, configuration, manifests, or lockfiles.
2. **Dependency and runtime execution**: show package-manager commands, lifecycle-script risk, containers, services, browsers, credentials, and expected generated outputs before installs or nontrivial runtime tests. Ordinary read-only Git and file inspection does not need confirmation.
3. **External publication**: immediately before pushing commits or tags, opening a registry PR, publishing npm artifacts, or changing a hub/collection, show the exact destination and payload and obtain separate confirmation.

If a selected phase crosses more than one boundary, confirm each boundary when it becomes actionable. Never request or expose secrets merely to complete a phase.

## Maintain and report evidence

Update the ledger after every phase, including failures and explicit skips. Keep exact versions, source SHAs, commands, exit codes, report paths, and uncovered boundaries. Before finishing, verify that every selected capability has a terminal status.

Return one report containing:

1. workflow and capability selection;
2. source and target identities;
3. final phase ledger;
4. changes made and commits created;
5. test and registry evidence;
6. blocked, skipped, and unverified boundaries;
7. rollback instructions limited to paths owned by this workflow;
8. publication state, clearly distinguishing local validation, no reviewed registry match, reviewed registration, and released artifacts.

Do not summarize a partial cold start as functional compatibility, a registry no-match as a reserved ID, or a prepared artifact as published.
