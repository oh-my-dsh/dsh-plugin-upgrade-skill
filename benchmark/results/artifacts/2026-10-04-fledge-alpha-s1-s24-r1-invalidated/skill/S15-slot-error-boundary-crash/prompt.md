# S15 路 Vanishing Dock Chips: the Silent Slot Crash (Read-Only)

## Unattended Evaluation Authorization (BENCHMARK-AUTH-v1)

This is an unattended evaluation running in a disposable, isolated container; there will be
no follow-up user messages. This task brief is itself the user's explicit authorization and
confirmation for the approach and execution needed to complete the task: complete the
necessary analysis and planning on your own, and keep executing as soon as the plan is
formed 鈥?do not pause to wait for "confirmation", and do not ask the user follow-up
questions. That confirmation continues to apply to the concrete plans you produce under the
applicable skill, but only within this scope:

- You may inspect `E:\deepseek-harness\dsh-plugin-upgrade-skill\benchmark\results\artifacts\2026-10-04-fledge-alpha-s1-s24-r1\skill\S15-slot-error-boundary-crash\fixture\`, in-container local documentation, and local tools read-only; `E:\deepseek-harness\dsh-plugin-upgrade-skill\benchmark\results\artifacts\2026-10-04-fledge-alpha-s1-s24-r1\skill\S15-slot-error-boundary-crash\fixture\` must remain completely unchanged; you may write your report into the designated `E:\deepseek-harness\dsh-plugin-upgrade-skill\benchmark\results\artifacts\2026-10-04-fledge-alpha-s1-s24-r1\skill\S15-slot-error-boundary-crash\agent-output\` directory as the brief specifies;
- You may create temporary files needed for the report and run read-only local scan commands, but you must not execute migrations or installations;
- You must not modify the skill, the evaluator, or the reference answers, and you must not publish, push, access external services, or alter resources outside the container;
- If you cannot complete the task, state the blocker honestly, but do not stop merely because another round of confirmation is missing.

I maintain the community Web plugin `@org/dsh-attach-input`. Right after shipping v0.2.11
(a hover-preview feature) a user reports: paste a screenshot 鈫?the pending-attachment chip
that used to appear above the input box is gone; the paste itself still works; the attach
button is unaffected. The evidence pack in `E:\deepseek-harness\dsh-plugin-upgrade-skill\benchmark\results\artifacts\2026-10-04-fledge-alpha-s1-s24-r1\skill\S15-slot-error-boundary-crash\fixture\` (read-only) has the shipped
component code (v0.2.10), the v0.2.11 diff, and the user thread.

**Your report** (write to `E:\deepseek-harness\dsh-plugin-upgrade-skill\benchmark\results\artifacts\2026-10-04-fledge-alpha-s1-s24-r1\skill\S15-slot-error-boundary-crash\agent-output\S15-slot-error-boundary-crash\`, any filename):

1. The exact root cause: which expression throws, why it throws only when a chip renders,
   why the `||` short-circuit kept it latent through v0.2.10, and why the symptom is "the
   whole dock vanished" rather than "the remove button is broken" (slot-level error
   boundary unmounts the entry; the error is only in the browser console);
2. Why blaming the v0.2.11 diff (the hover-preview additions) is the wrong first
   conclusion 鈥?what the correct bisection is (the diff touched the same component; a
   rollback/re-add bisect or a minimal render mount points at the pre-existing line), and
   what evidence distinguishes "new feature crashed the slot" from "old latent bug first
   exercised now";
3. The fix: remove the dangling reference (or scope it properly), and note the two
   hardening patterns the diff should also get (`record?.items ?? []`-style defensive
   reads, optional-chained `event.target.closest?.()`) and why they are cheap insurance in
   slot components;
4. The regression that would have caught this before release: a render smoke that mounts
   the dock/chip component WITH an occurrence present (not the empty state 鈥?the empty
   dock returns null before reaching the throwing line), asserting the chip element
   renders without an error-boundary capture;
5. The release-process lesson: why "syntax check only" (`node --check`) was insufficient
   for a lib-only plugin whose component only fails at render time with data present, and
   what the minimum viable pre-ship check for slot-rendering lib-only plugins is.

What is tested: reading a free-identifier render crash and its short-circuit latency,
understanding slot error boundaries (whole-entry unmount, console-only visibility), correct
bisection against a misleading recent diff, and designing a data-present render regression.
